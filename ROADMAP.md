# Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, in the browser

**Goal:** boot a genuine, unmodified **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS amd64** with a **graphical
desktop** and **working networking** (`apt install`, `curl`), running entirely in a
web browser via WebAssembly full-system emulation.

## The hard constraint

Browsers offer no native virtualization (no KVM), no raw syscalls, and no raw TCP
sockets. So this is **software full-system emulation of an x86-64 machine compiled
to WebAssembly**, fed a real disk image, with its framebuffer painted to a `<canvas>`
and its network tunneled through a WebSocket→TCP proxy. It will be **slow** — that is
inherent to the browser, not a bug we can engineer away. The target is an impressive,
*real* demo, not a daily driver.

## Chosen shape

- **Fidelity:** exactly Ubuntu 22.04 amd64 (64-bit), unmodified image.
- **Interface:** full GUI desktop rendered to canvas.
- **Networking:** yes — real internet via a proxy.
- **Engine:** amd64-capable emulator compiled to WASM (QEMU-TCG-WASM vs Bochs-WASM /
  container2wasm) — **TBD, pending the Phase-0 research.**

## Phases (each ends in something that visibly works)

- **Phase 0 — Foundation & proof-of-life.** Pick the engine. Scaffold the app. Boot a
  *tiny* amd64 Linux (busybox/alpine) to a canvas. Proves the whole pipeline.
- **Phase 1 — Ubuntu to a console.** Real Ubuntu 22.04 amd64 disk image boots to a text TTY.
- **Phase 2 — The desktop.** X + a desktop environment painted to canvas; keyboard + mouse input.
- **Phase 3 — Networking.** WebSocket→TCP proxy so `apt`/`curl` reach the internet + DNS.
- **Phase 4 — Persistence & speed.** IndexedDB write overlay, snapshot save/restore,
  HTTP-range streaming of the disk image so it doesn't download multi-GB up front.
- **Phase 5 — Ship.** Host the image (range-capable static host) + the net proxy (small server).

## Recovery / history

- `pre-rebuild` tag — the original portfolio site.
- `scrapped-ethanos` branch — the earlier EthanOS "WebOS" experiment.
